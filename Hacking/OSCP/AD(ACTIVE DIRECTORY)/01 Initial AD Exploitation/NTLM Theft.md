## NTLM Theft
### NTLM (NT LAN Manager) is a suite of Microsoft security protocols that provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality to users. It is commonly used in Windows environments for network authentication.

### NTLM Theft refers to the unauthorized acquisition of NTLM hashes, which can be used to authenticate to systems without needing the plaintext password. This is a common attack vector in Active Directory environments.
### Common Methods of NTLM Theft:
1. **Pass-the-Hash (PtH)**: An attacker captures the NTLM hash of a user's password and uses it to authenticate to other systems without needing the plaintext password.
2. **NTLM Relay**: An attacker captures the NTLM hash of a user's password and relays it to another system for authentication.
3. **Kerberos Ticket Stealing**: An attacker captures the Kerberos ticket of a user and uses it to authenticate to other systems without needing the plaintext password.
