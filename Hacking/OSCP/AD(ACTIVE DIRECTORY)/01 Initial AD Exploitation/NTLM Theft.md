## NTLM Theft
### NTLM (NT LAN Manager) is a suite of Microsoft security protocols that provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality to users. It is commonly used in Windows environments for network authentication.

### NTLM Theft refers to the unauthorized acquisition of NTLM hashes, which can be used to authenticate to systems without needing the plaintext password. This is a common attack vector in Active Directory environments.

### Common Methods of NTLM Theft:
1. ***Pass-the-Hash (PtH)***: An attacker captures the NTLM hash of a user's password and uses it to authenticate to other systems without needing the plaintext password.
2. ***NTLM Relay***: An attacker captures the NTLM hash of a user's password and relays it to another system for authentication.
3. ***Kerberos Ticket Stealing***: An attacker captures the Kerberos ticket of a user and uses it to authenticate to other systems without needing the plaintext password.

### Tools for NTLM Theft:
- **Responder**: A tool that can be used to capture NTLM hashes by responding to NetBIOS and LLMNR requests.
- **John the Ripper**: A tool that can be used to crack NTLM hashes.
- **Ntlmrelayx**: A tool that can be used to relay NTLM hashes to other systems.
















### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure that users have strong passwords that are difficult to crack.
- **Use Multiple Authentication Methods**: Use multiple authentication methods, such as MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
- **Use Secure Password Storage**: Use secure password storage, such as a password manager.
- **Monitor for Suspicious Activity**: Monitor for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts or unusual authentication patterns.
- **Disable NTLM**: Disable NTLM authentication where possible, and use Kerberos instead.
